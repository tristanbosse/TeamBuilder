# My Personal Project

## TeamTracker

Application Description

The goal of the application will be to serve as a centralized hub for tracking a soccer team’s players, results, and statistics.  There will be three main distinct classes involved in the programming of the application: **Team**, **Player**, and **Game**, however there will be subclasses to represent a players’ positions. The main target audience for this application would be coaches who need to easily be able to access their teams information. This project is of interest to me because firstly I grew up playing sports and am still very passionate about soccer to this day, and a lot of the teams I grew up playing on lacked this sort of central information hub.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add objects of class *player* to an object of class *team*.
- As a user, I want to be able to add attributes to objects of type player (Position, Games Played, Goals, etc.)
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of players on the team
- As a user, I want to be able view all past results, including score, opponent, and goalscorers.
- As a user, when I want to quit my application, I want to be reminded to save my team information, and I want to be given the option whether or not to do so. 
- As a user, when I open my application up again, I want to be given the option to load previous team information from file.

# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required event related to adding players to a team by clicking on the "Add Player" button on the command screen.
- You can generate the second required event related to adding players to a team by clicking on the "Add Game" button on the command screen and adding a new game. This will update the players' statistics.
- You can locate my visual component in the start screen (where you're prompted to create a new team or load an old one.)

# Phase 4: Task 3

Having completed my project, I believe there are a few things that I could've done better.
The main and biggest one however would be that I wish I had created an association between 
my Player class and my Game class. I think it would've made certain tasks
(such as updating statistics) much easier than it turned out to be. Overall 
however I did complete my intended user stories which I'm satisfied with, but this project has definitley been 
a learning experience.
